## Wait, but what is Hacktober? 🎃
Consider Hacktober a chance to try something new that scares you, or continue on a legacy side project that also scares you. We'll work in pairs:

1. :candy: Trick or treating - meet your neighbors: **Stand Up, Halloween style** _What is one spooky, terrifying thing that has scared you recently and how are you or did you get over it?_

Send them a treat by writing them a thank you tweet/note.
4. :jack_o_lantern: Teach **tricks and learn a trick**: Go out of your way to take 3 minutes to look up that keyboard shortcut, create that alias, or learn some other new side-trick you've been meaning to practice. learn a new command line command. then teach your neighbor.
