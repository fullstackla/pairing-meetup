# Fullstack community

The most important part about Fullstack ⚡️ is creating and building our community here. Every week at our meetups, we create a space and time to meet and pair together to keep this community growing 🌱 . We dedicate this space in this directory to give people a chance to introduce themselves and also celebrate how much our community has grown:

1. Create a text file including your name, a short bio, contact information, and languages you're using or learning (use format below). The name of the profile .md file should be your GitHub name (i.e. username.md).
2. Create a Pull Request to submit your profile.


```
# <Name>

- GitHub: <URL>
- Languages: <languages>
```
